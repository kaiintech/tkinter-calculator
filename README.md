# Python Calculator (Tkinter)

A simple calculator application built with Python’s **Tkinter** library.
This project replicates the functionality and styling of a basic calculator while showcasing how to build a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python.

---

## Features

* Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Support for decimals.
* Clear (`C`) and delete last input (`DEL`) functionality.
* Displays full expressions (e.g., `3+3`) before evaluation.
* Fixed-size window with styled buttons and display.
* Aqua-themed design with black background for buttons.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** (standard Python GUI library)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaiintech/tkinter-calculator.git
   cd calculator
   ```

2. Run the program with Python 3:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## Usage

* Enter numbers by clicking the digit buttons.
* Use `+`, `-`, `x`, `/` for arithmetic operations.
* Press `=` to evaluate the expression.
* Use `C` to clear all input.
* Use `DEL` to remove the last character.

---

## Example

* Input: `7 + 8`
* Press `=`
* Output: `15`

---

## Future Improvements

* Add keyboard support.
* Implement advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponents).
* Improve styling with themes or animations.
